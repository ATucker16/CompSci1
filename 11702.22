//    my first life was so boring just forget i mentioned it
//    and my second seemed to let me do all of the things my first life didn't
//    third life was a hateful man all poison to the bone
//    in my fourth i played piano but just didn't have the eyes to read the notes
//
//    in my fifth life i supported girls- of course that wasn't all
//    my sixth life was corrupted though i guess it was a little fun
//    seventh life i cried so much and all i did was mourn
//    in my eighth life, was so rich i could have bought the world and everything
//
//    in this life is a game played by a flaky god
//    he gambles every life
//    try to escape but you know the path you're on is game and set
//
//    see how the the game of life is playing all of us for fools
//    dancing a string around us making all these silly rules
//    see how he looks down on us like acting out a show
//    throw the dice and let's see which head will roll
//
//    by nine i drew some manga but the deadlines left me dead
//    my tenth life was a teacher, as a pedo**** ... i worked part time
//    next life, what eleven? sorry i try to forget
//    never could describe how awful, no i'm terrified to think of
//    all the things that such a die can do, kinda crazy
//    describing everyday
//    try to escape but the days repeat and keep you here to stay
//
//    see how the game of life is never won you only play
//    bore him and you will find you're crumpled up and thrown away
//    clinging to fate and blaming it when life won't go your way
//    such a laugh, HA! life is just a game
//
//    cry out all your eyes and win a new fortune
//    the chance is one out of six
//    try to escape, why not try your luck and see what you may get?
//
//    see how the the game of life is playing all of us for fools
//    dancing a string around us making all these silly rules
//    see how he looks down on us like acting out a show
//    throw the dice and let's see which head will roll
//
//    sickly grinning downwards, tosses out a pair of dice
//    cheating a way around the board, ah this is paradise
//    people praying on their knees but no one there to hear
//    ah look down at all the puppets here
//
//    ...ah look up at all the puppeteers...
